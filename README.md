# keywordparty by Shaun R. Best KG4NWV
Please see lalist on Github.  Keyword party is the same program for Windows / Dos users and lalist is the Linux users version.  Maybe you make lists of keywords for SEO Search Engine Optimization or some other reason you need to work with lists of one word which may also contain the normal 32 specail characters and have the power to compare lists and generate inverse lists of keywords which are not in the other list and generate a list of keywords matching in both lists.  The input files are not written to and 3 files will be output and all duplicates will be removed.  Character case is sensitive as in 'a' does not equal 'A'.
